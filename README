Some bizarre monitoring system
------------------------------

Written by cl3mens feb 2011

packit.sh should be placed on a client and run by a cron job
It depends on ifconfig, hostname, grep, awk, cut, bc and the 
cpu.sh/mem.sh/rootfs.sh scripts

Configure packit.sh to drop the .data-file at a location readable by
the monitoring server (preferably running apache as well)

generatePage.sh reads .data-files from it's workdir and generates
a HTML page for easy readouts

Wooooo!

Todo: 

* cpu.sh is a bit bloated, can we find current idle-percentage in another way?
* Cleaner way to get the IP address? No need for root would be nice
* Conditional formating of the cells would be cool as well
* Implement support for custom services (pid-file detection?)
* Flush the .data-file after reading it, creating a empty file. If a host dies, the empty file will be left indicating a problem to the generatePage.sh-script
* Solution? Don't include IP in .data, the server has a conf file with host+ip. Would eliminate need for empty files (kind of a fragile system).
